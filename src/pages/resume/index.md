## About me

I got interested in coding and educated myself in this field. Then since 2016 I've been working with python, java and front-end development in such domains as machine learning, blockchain and robotic automation. In the end I've decided to grow as a web developer. Until this day I've never stopped learning new things and excited to work on projects with a clear vision.

I can apply styles, layouts and JS, worked with Vue.JS and learned React while on quarantine of 2020. But frontend isn't my shiny side and I'll need mentoring on this path.

Git is what I version control my code with and only heard that there are Mercurial and SVN so no experience there. But I follow Git-flow with branching and squashing when needed. As of development methodologies I can say that Scrum is not a panacea. It works for some teams but sometimes it's better off without it.

I think it's great to have a team-lead or quarterly/semiannual tech-reviews where I can identify my weak spots.

I seek to work remotely because I'm well organized and already have experience in working with distributed teams. I'm aiming for the result not for sitting sacred hours that's why I can agree at tracking time on tasks at most. But no crazy screenshot/webcam/activity trackers, sorry. Also I'm against heavy bureaucracy, because it just kills all aspiration.

Lastly, I have strong boundaries between work and personal life and I'm not ready to give all my time to the former, even if it compensates me three times as high.
