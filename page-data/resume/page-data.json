Then since 2016 I've been working with python, java and front-end development. It led me to web development alongside machine learning, blockchain and robotic automation. Until this day I've never stopped learning new things and excited to work on cool projects.</p>\n<p>I love to develop on a Linux-based system, the best option would be the Arch. Just not Windows as I've seen a lot of things simply don't work there.</p>\n<p>I can apply styles, layouts and JS, worked with Vue.JS and learned React while on quarantine. But frontend isn't my shiny side and I'll need mentoring on this path.</p>\n<p>Git is what I version control my code with and only heard that there are Mercurial and SVN so no experience there. But I follow Git-flow with branching and squashing when needed. As of development methodologies I can say that Scrum is not a panacea. It works for some teams but sometimes it's better off without it.</p>\n<p>I think it's great to have a team-lead or a team of experienced developers to learn from. Or at least have quarterly/semiannual tech-reviews where I can identify my weak spots. Situations when all my growth as a developer is fixed solely on me are out of my interest.</p>\n<p>I seek to work remotely because I'm well organized and already have experience in working with distributed teams. I'm aiming for the result not for sitting sacred hours that's why I can agree at tracking time on tasks at most. But no crazy screenshot/webcam/activity trackers, sorry. Also I'm against heavy bureaucracy, because it just kills all aspiration.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I have a strong boundaries between work and personal life and I'm not ready to give all my time to the former, even if it compensates me three times as high.</p>\n<h2>Hackathons</h2>\n<h3>\"AI &#x26; BigData in medicine, education and neurocommunications\" hackathon by <a href=\"https://www.skoltech.ru/en\">Skoltech</a> and <a href=\"https://www.philips.com/global\">Philips</a></h3>\n<p>5.04.2019 â€“ 7.04.2019</p>\n<p>Victory while solving a problem of classifying types of epilepsy attacks.</p>\n<h3>Third \"IT-hackathon on the financial services development\" by <a href=\"https://akbars.digital\">AkBars Digital</a></h3>\n<p>29.03.2019 â€“ 30.03.2019</p>\n<p>Second place with project \"Client passport photo verification\" via <a href=\"https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition\">facerecognition</a>.</p>\n<h2>Education</h2>\n<p>Kazan State Technical University, 2008 - 2013, Masters degree in Technology of mechanical engineering and organization of production.</p>\n<h2>Self study</h2>\n<p>Python programming courses on <a href=\"https://coursera.org\">Coursera</a>, dived into algorithms on <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org\">KhanAcademy</a> and learned other stuff around the internet (databases, deployment, html/css/js, etc.).</p>\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Russian (native)</li>\n<li>English (upper-intermediate, reading tech/non-tech literature, watching movies/TV, didnâ€™t have much of a practice in speaking).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Interests</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoga</li>\n<li>Kendo</li>\n<li>Reading fiction/non-fiction</li>\n<li>Translating articles on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@c.v.ya\">medium</a> (en -> ru).</li>\n</ul>"},"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/blog/static/c09628fc40e12f0be43e80b8972d91da/14b42/aron-visuals-BXOXnQ26B7o-unsplash.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
