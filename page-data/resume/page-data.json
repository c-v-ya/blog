Then since 2016 I've been working with python, java and front-end development in such domains as machine learning, blockchain and robotic automation. In the end I've decided to grow as a web developer. Until this day I've never stopped learning new things and excited to work on projects with a clear vision.</p>\n<p>I can apply styles, layouts and JS, worked with Vue.JS and learned React while on quarantine of 2020. But frontend isn't my shiny side and I'll need mentoring on this path.</p>\n<p>Git is what I version control my code with and only heard that there are Mercurial and SVN so no experience there. But I follow Git-flow with branching and squashing when needed. As of development methodologies I can say that Scrum is not a panacea. It works for some teams but sometimes it's better off without it.</p>\n<p>I think it's great to have a team-lead or quarterly/semiannual tech-reviews where I can identify my weak spots.</p>\n<p>I seek to work remotely because I'm well organized and already have experience in working with distributed teams. I'm aiming for the result not for sitting sacred hours that's why I can agree at tracking time on tasks at most. But no crazy screenshot/webcam/activity trackers, sorry. Also I'm against heavy bureaucracy, because it just kills all aspiration.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I have strong boundaries between work and personal life and I'm not ready to give all my time to the former, even if it compensates me three times as high.</p>\n<h2>Hackathons</h2>\n<h3>\"AI &#x26; BigData in medicine, education and neurocommunications\" hackathon by <a href=\"https://www.skoltech.ru/en\">Skoltech</a> and <a href=\"https://www.philips.com/global\">Philips</a></h3>\n<p>5.04.2019 — 7.04.2019</p>\n<p>Victory while solving a problem of classifying types of epilepsy attacks.</p>\n<h3>Third \"IT-hackathon on the financial services development\" by <a href=\"https://akbars.digital\">AkBars Digital</a></h3>\n<p>29.03.2019 — 30.03.2019</p>\n<p>Second place with project \"Client passport photo verification\" via <a href=\"https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition\">facerecognition</a>.</p>\n<h2>Education</h2>\n<p>Kazan State Technical University, 2008 - 2013, Masters degree in Technology of mechanical engineering and organization of production.</p>\n<h2>Self study</h2>\n<p>Python programming courses on <a href=\"https://coursera.org\">Coursera</a>, dived into algorithms on <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org\">KhanAcademy</a> and learned other stuff around the internet (databases, deployment, html/css/js, etc.).</p>\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Russian (native)</li>\n<li>English (upper-intermediate, reading tech/non-tech literature, watching movies/TV, didn’t have much of a practice in speaking).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Interests</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoga</li>\n<li>Kendo</li>\n<li>Reading fiction/non-fiction</li>\n<li>Translating articles on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@c.v.ya\">medium</a> (en -> ru).</li>\n</ul>"},"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/blog/static/7c0cd565198894fc6144d357c881183a/14b42/anne-nygard-RaUUoAnVgcA-unsplash.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
